# SQL
This is a Python ETL pipeline, that extracts user and songs activity data to create star schema using postgres.

Datasets
song dataset - json data that contains artist and song information
log dataset - jsons data that contains user activity
Star schema created by pipeline
Fact table
songplays - records in log data associated with song plays
Dimension tables
users - users associated with songs being played
songs - songs that are being played by users
aritsts - artist of the songs that are being played
time - time when songs are played
Running the pipeline
To run we need python3 and postgres.

Create the star schema
You must create the star schema tables before running the pipeline.

To create the tables run:

python3 create_tables.py
this will drop tables if they exist and create new emplty tables

Run the Pipeline
Once the star schema tables are created you can run the pipeline

To run the pipeline run:

python3 etl.py
this will extract the data from the json files and insert it in the star schema, insert your own json files.
